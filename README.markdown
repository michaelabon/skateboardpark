Middle-click will rotate the camera. Shift + middle-click will pan the camera.

## Where This Started

This started as a final project for our Intro to Computer Graphics courrse. We
had to implement a 3D modeler, i.e., an interactive program to let the user
build interesting 3D models. Not only did we get top marks for our assignment,
our project was inducted into the course hall of fame for implementing so many
additional features, like textures, lighting, anti-aliasing, and anisotropic
filtering.

## Final Grade

There were a few basic features required: programmed in OpenGL, fully 3D,
interactive, and saving/loading of models. Other than that, we were free to do
whatever we wanted, with additional and more advanced features counting towards
a better grade.

We were awarded 17 / 16 for our exceptional project.
